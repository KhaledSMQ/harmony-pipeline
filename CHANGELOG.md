# Changelog

All notable changes to the harmony-pipeline project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-15

### Added

#### Core Pipeline Engine

- **PipelineExecutor**: Robust execution engine with stage dependency resolution
- **Stage-based architecture**: Processors organized into stages with dependency management
- **DAG validation**: Automatic detection of circular dependencies in stage definitions
- **Event system**: Comprehensive event emission for pipeline lifecycle monitoring
- **Abort signal support**: Graceful cancellation through AbortController integration

#### Processor Management

- **PipelineProcessor interface**: Flexible processor definition with lifecycle hooks
- **Setup/teardown lifecycle**: Automatic resource management for processors
- **Error handling hooks**: Custom error recovery logic per processor
- **Version tracking**: Semantic versioning support for processors
- **Concurrent execution**: Configurable concurrency within stages

#### Builder Pattern

- **PipelineBuilder**: Fluent API for pipeline construction
- **Method chaining**: Intuitive builder pattern for processor registration
- **Conditional registration**: Dynamic processor addition based on conditions
- **Factory support**: Processor creation using factory functions
- **Pipeline cloning**: Create derivative pipelines from existing builders

#### Context and Metadata

- **Typed context system**: Type-safe metadata propagation throughout pipeline
- **Warning collection**: Non-fatal issue tracking with structured data
- **Execution tracking**: Unique execution IDs and timing information
- **Logger integration**: Pluggable logging system with multiple levels

#### Error Handling and Recovery

- **Granular error control**: Configure stop-on-error vs continue-on-error behavior
- **Warning system**: Collect and report non-fatal issues without stopping execution
- **Error aggregation**: Comprehensive error collection across all stages
- **Timeout support**: Configurable pipeline execution timeouts
- **Graceful degradation**: Continue processing when possible after failures

#### Type Safety and Developer Experience

- **Full TypeScript support**: End-to-end type safety for inputs, outputs, and context
- **Generic type system**: Flexible typing for different data shapes
- **Type guards**: Runtime type checking utilities for result handling
- **Comprehensive JSDoc**: Detailed documentation for all public APIs
- **IDE integration**: Rich autocomplete and type checking support

#### Monitoring and Observability

- **Execution events**: Detailed event emission for all pipeline operations
- **Performance metrics**: Timing information for stages and processors
- **Result introspection**: Detailed outcome information for debugging
- **Stage execution order**: Visualization support for pipeline structure
- **Processor registration tracking**: Runtime inspection of pipeline configuration

#### Utilities and Helpers

- **Factory functions**: Convenient creation functions for all core objects
- **Deep freeze utility**: Immutable object creation for thread safety
- **Null logger**: Silent logging implementation for production use
- **Execution options**: Comprehensive configuration system with sensible defaults
- **Result type guards**: Helper functions for type-safe result handling

### Architecture Decisions

#### Design Principles

- **Separation of concerns**: Clear boundaries between execution, building, and configuration
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class and function has a focused purpose
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Extensible through interfaces, closed for modification
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
- **DRY compliance**: Shared utilities prevent code duplication

#### Performance Optimizations

- **Lazy initialization**: Setup methods called only when needed
- **Event listener safety**: Automatic error isolation in event handlers
- **Memory efficiency**: Frozen objects and minimal object creation
- **Concurrent execution**: Optional parallelism within stages when beneficial
- **Early termination**: Stop execution immediately on critical errors when configured

#### Security and Reliability

- **Input validation**: Comprehensive validation of processor and stage configurations
- **Error isolation**: Processor failures don't affect other processors
- **Signal propagation**: Proper AbortSignal handling throughout the execution chain
- **Resource cleanup**: Automatic teardown of processor resources
- **Immutable results**: Frozen result objects prevent accidental modification

### Development Tools

#### Build System

- **Rollup configuration**: Optimized bundling for both CommonJS and ES modules
- **TypeScript compilation**: Strict type checking with comprehensive compiler options
- **Declaration generation**: Full type definition export for consuming applications
- **Source maps**: Debug support with accurate source mapping

#### Testing Infrastructure

- **Jest configuration**: Comprehensive test setup with coverage reporting
- **Custom matchers**: Pipeline-specific assertions for test clarity
- **Mock utilities**: Helper functions for testing pipeline components
- **Setup utilities**: Shared test infrastructure and data factories
- **Coverage thresholds**: Minimum 85% coverage requirement across all metrics

#### Quality Assurance

- **TypeScript strict mode**: Maximum type safety with strict compiler settings
- **Linting configuration**: ESLint setup for code consistency
- **Git hooks**: Pre-commit validation of code quality
- **Bundle size monitoring**: Automated size tracking with bundlewatch
